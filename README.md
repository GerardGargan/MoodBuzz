# CSC7084 Web Development Project

This repository contains some static HTML, CSS and Javascript for the CSC7084 Web Development Module.

The Project will eventually incorporate Node.js, express and MySQL databases for the backend. Since we are still learning how to incporate those in full detail, I wanted to get a head start on the static webpages and design.

This repository will hold the initial static webpages which will be followed up later with the dynamic web app utilising Node.js, Express and MySQL in a separate repository.
